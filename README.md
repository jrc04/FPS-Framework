# FPS Framework
 This project was made over the course of several months in short Unity sessions, and is my second attempt at making a game. This repository contains the source code of the prototype game.
 The prototype includes several different features, including:
 -Custom enemy AI with navmeshing
 -Several different guns
 -A pause menu with music, sfx, and sensitivity options
 -UI with reactive ammo count and health bars
 -A graybox house with simple models
